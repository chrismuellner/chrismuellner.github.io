    Tried out [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com) where a new problem statement is released for each day in advent.

    Solved a problem statement with different inputs of increasing difficulty in a group of 4 people.
    Found and improved upon a heuristic to rate the various inputs and adapt it for the different input sets.
