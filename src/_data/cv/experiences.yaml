    I drove the first major release of the Dynatrace Operator with accompanying procedures, improving security processes, automating release process and testing on Github, migrating the Operator to a simpler setup experience using an OCI chart. I refined the onboarding experience in the official documentation explaining guides for complex setups.
    
    I designed the major evolution of the Custom Resource, in cooperation with the Team, Product Architects and Product Mangement, integrating learnings from the previous iterations into the process and allowing easier addition of new components in the future.

    Throughout, I owned product topics for a team growing to 10 people and facilitated the team split to allow for further growth.

    I took over ownership of the Kubernetes Operator project and was responsible for managing and prioritizing different product topics for a growing team. I improved the development workflow for all developers by setting up Jira dashboards to provide easier access for important work and external requests. I worked on onboarding additional teams to the project, allowing their product features to be rolled out by a single platform.

    I simplified the data collection for troubleshooting and reduced the initial triage time for support requests.
    By switching to a distroless image and reducing the attack surface, I was able to integrate image scan outputs into a newly created database of known vulnerability, reducing the time it took for customers to be informed about their impact.
